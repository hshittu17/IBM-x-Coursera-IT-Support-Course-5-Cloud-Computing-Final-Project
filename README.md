# IBM-x-Coursera-IT-Support-Course-5-Cloud-Computing-Final-Project
This hands-on lab is from Course 5 of the IT Support Professional Certification by IBM and Courera. I built a docker container image, uploaded it to IBM Cloud Container Registry, and deployed an application on cloud using a serverless technology called IBM Code Engine! The application is a guessing game where users guess the captal of a country.
